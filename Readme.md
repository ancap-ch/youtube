Japanese translations discontinued! If you want to take over, please contact swfsql@gmail.com

Now this is about a portuguese youtube channel "pelud√£o da praxeologia" (praxeology hairy guy).
If I have enough donations, i'll start a discussion forum, resume japanese translations and start thai translations (I'll pay someone).
