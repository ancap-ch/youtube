1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,820
Imagine you have a friend called George. You've been friends since childhood.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Although you're not as close as you were back then, you still see each other once in a while

3
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:21,100
and get along very well.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,720
One day you and George are approached by an old mutual friend, Oliver.

5
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,719
Oliver explains that he's had a run of bad luck and is raising money to cover tuition

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,018
fees for his kids.

7
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:40,619
You want to help Oliver out so you give him some money.

8
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:47,619
To your surprise George doesn't offer Oliver any help.

9
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,978
You try to persuade him but it's no use.

10
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:58,829
Imagining yourself in this situation, do you think it's okay to threaten to use physical

11
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,500
force against George to get him to do the right thing?

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,329
Now imagine a slightly different situation. This time, a group of your friends take a

13
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:18,329
vote. Six out of ten are in favour of threatening George to get him to help Oliver. Does this

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,030
democratic process make it okay to threaten George?

15
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:33,000
One last change to the situation: This time imagine that many thousands of people have

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,299
democratically agreed that a group, who we'll call the agents, should do whatever is necessary

17
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,780
to take money from George and give it to Oliver's family.

18
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,780
The agents don't explicitly threaten George at first, all they do is send him a bill.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,340
Like everyone else though, George knows what will happen if he doesn't pay the bill; First,

20
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,020
he'll get more letters demanding payment, and the bill will get bigger.

21
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:11,939
Eventually, if he still doesn't pay, agents with guns will break into his house and take

22
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,250
him away against his will.

23
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,759
Almost everyone pays the bills without protest, they know the agents are prepared to use as

24
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,340
much force as necessary to overpower you if you resist.

25
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,340
Do you think it's acceptable for the agents to threaten violence against George if he

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,520
doesn't give his money towards helping Oliver's family?

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,400
If we approve of state programs that redistribute wealth, we must also approve of threats of

28
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,400
violence made against peaceful individuals, because this is how the funds are collected.

29
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,400
On the other hand, most of us feel uncomfortable about threatening peaceful people when we

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,459
imagine having to make the threats ourselves.

31
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,598
If we feel negatively towards the idea of threatening George personally, can we really

32
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:18,598
be comfortable with the threats made against him by agents of the state?

33
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,739
Some people believe that voluntary interaction, and spontaneous order, are realistic and preferable

34
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,580
alternatives to state coercion as a way of organizing society.

35
