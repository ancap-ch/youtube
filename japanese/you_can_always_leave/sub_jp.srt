1
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,499
Imagine you have a friend called George...

2
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,059
This story was misleading.

3
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,820
George isn't being threatened! He's just being asked to pay his fair share

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,520
like the rest of us. If he doesn't like the arrangement he can always leave.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,300
let's start with the question of whether or not the state threatens people.

6
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,929
Imagine a desert island.

7
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:46,710
Albin lives with a few other people on this island.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,369
One day he meets Jeff.

9
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,519
Jeff says

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,390
Give me your ball!

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,109
Or you'll get a beating.

12
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,609
Jeff's threatening Albin with violence, right?

13
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,798
Yeah of course.

14
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:01,149
But taxpayers aren't being threatened like that.

15
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,109
No one actually gets attacked for not paying taxes.

16
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:07,670
Okay. Let's have Jeff say something different.

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,609
He says:

18
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,299
Give me your ball!

19
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,659
If you don't, I'll have to ask you to hand over your ball and your shirt.

20
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,319
If you still don't cooperate,

21
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,389
you'll spend the night tied to that tree.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,409
And if you resist being tied, you'll get a beating.

23
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,450
Now, Jeff's defenders could insist he'd never attack someone for something as trivial

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,500
as refusing to hand over a ball.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,599
He'd only use violence as a last resort,

26
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,368
as a penalty for breaking the rules and resisting the proper punishment.

27
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,840
No matter how Jeff explains it though, he's still threatening Albin with violence, right?

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,040
Okay. Yes, Jeff's still threatening Albin with violence,

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,950
even if the violence is a couple of steps removed.

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,689
But this isn't a good analogy for taxation.

31
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,798
For one thing, modern states use taxes to provide services that help people.

32
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,680
So what if you learned that Jeff just wanted to improve Albin's ball

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,210
and give it back to him as a surprise.

35
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,039
I guess I don't see Jeff as so much of a bad guy anymore,

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,618
but he is still threatening Albin, which isn't okay.

37
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:12,389
There are more differences between Jeff and the state though.

38
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,338
The state relies on taxation so that it can provide stuff

39
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:17,889
that just wouldn't be possible otherwise,

40
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,870
like roads...

41
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,528
Private roads do exist you know.

42
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:22,359
alright then, essential services like fire fighters

43
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:27,308
There are private fire services too

44
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:29,859
Well what about a reliable social safety net? Charity alone isn't enough!

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,130
Before the compulsory welfare state

46
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:34,620
crowded them out,

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,169
there used to be lots of mutual aid societies.

48
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,959
Together with charities, they did a pretty good job of taking care of the needy.

49
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,509
Anyway, for the sake of discussion,

50
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:47,318
let's assume that there are some important things that can only be provided using taxation.

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,859
So Jeff isn't interested in Albin's ball anymore.

52
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:56,759
Now he wants his gold coins. He's collecting money to build a fish farm.

53
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:00,588
There was a serious fish shortage last month and Albin agrees

54
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,780
that a farm would be a good idea,

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,909
but he doesn't trust Jeff with his money.  He'd prefer to use it in other ways.

56
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,348
Jeff says

57
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:11,699
The farm will benefit everyone, and everyone else has paid their share.

58
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,429
It just wouldn't be fair if you didn't chip in.

59
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,769
That's why you'll get a beating if you don't hand over the money.

60
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:22,569
Jeff just wants to prevent Albin from free-riding on an improvement

61
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,618
that will help everyone!

62
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:27,049
But isn't he still threatening Albin with violence?

63
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,569
Alright

64
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:32,458
But in a modern democracy it's the people who decide the law,

65
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,838
through their representatives,

66
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,068
that's very different to an island where there's no representation.

67
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:41,179
Okay, let's change things on the island to fix that.

68
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,019
Some of the islanders decide

69
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,579
that there should be a ruler with certain powers the other islanders don't have.

70
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,448
This ruler is chosen by a vote, and Jeff was the first winner.

71
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,309
Like before, Jeff is telling Albin to pay towards the improvements he has planned.

72
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:59,989
If Albin doesn't surrender the money demanded, he'll be told to hand over

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,188
even more.

74
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:06,549
If he consistently refuses, eventually the Island Guards will show up at his house,

75
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,149
take him away and lock him up.

76
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:14,139
When his kidnappers arrive, Albin could try to get them to leave by shouting a warning

77
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,369
and drawing a weapon. But he realises it's far more likely that he'll be killed

78
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:23,290
than succeed in escaping the state's chain of demands and punishments,

79
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,239
at least while staying on the island.

80
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:29,028
Wait, wait, wait! police officers aren't killers!

81
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:30,718
They don't usually need to be,

82
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:33,889
But think about it like this: What do you think would happen if there was no

83
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,460
danger to Albin of being killed, no matter how far he went in his resistance?

84
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,719
If the guards just left people alone who defended themselves powerfully enough,

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,289
word would get out that you could safely ignore their demands. I think a great many

86
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:50,449
people would choose open resistance. I bet even those who liked the idea of a state

87
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,810
would resist. They'd be asking themselves

88
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,680
Why should I be the sucker paying a big chunk of my income for all these

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,718
free-riders when there's a safe and easy way out?

90
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,728
The guards hardly ever use actual violence against people like Albin.

91
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:10,098
As long as most people at least have the idea that resistance is futile,

92
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,838
that's enough to keep the state functioning.

93
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:17,189
Because the guards very rarely need to use violence, people might even forget

94
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,060
that the state is ultimately ready to use deadly force to secure obedience.

95
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,350
Yes yes okay! So maybe

96
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,479
taxation does depend on threats of violence,

97
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:30,490
but that doesn't mean that taxation is theft.

98
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,939
Every citizen is bound by the social contract.

99
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,559
You live in a country knowing what's expected of you, and what the punishments are

100
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,860
if you don't follow the rules.

101
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,790
If you really don't like the terms, most states do allow you to leave.

102
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,749
And I know what you're going to say: I never signed a social contract!

103
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,449
But that doesn't matter.

104
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,810
When the bill arrives in a restaurant, you have an obligation to pay

105
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,759
even though you didn't sign anything.

106
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,098
It's the same kind of thing with the social contract.

107
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:02,569
By staying in a country, at least after you're old enough to leave,

108
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,220
you're agreeing to abide by the rules, and you're granting permission

109
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,600
to have certain kinds of force used against you

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,789
if you don't stick to those rules.

111
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,680
Hang on a second. The restaurant boss gets to set the rules because he owns the restaurant.

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,240
It's being the owner of a thing that gives you the right to say who gets to

113
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,139
use it, and how.

114
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,900
Some people say that a social contract exists between the state and the citizen.

115
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,418
Okay.

116
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,829
But how did the state come to be the owner of the land of imposes its laws on?

117
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,859
It's important to know because if it's not the owner

118
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,550
then the state has no authority to set the terms of use of that land

119
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,919
and it's actually aggressing against the people it taxes.

120
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,718
Some people don't believe that the state is the rightful owner of the land it claims.

121
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:51,418
To understand why, think back to the island as it was right at the beginning,

122
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,698
before we made all the changes.

123
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,189
In some remote corner of the island Albin finds some wood lying on the ground

124
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,588
and uses it to build a hut there.

125
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:05,079
Do you think that Albin owns the hut, meaning: does Albin have the right to

126
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,209
say how other people may or may not use the hut?

127
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,749
Yeah sure Albin's the owner.

128
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,650
Does Jeff have the right to demand

129
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,978
that Albin follow a set of rules in order to continue using the hut?

130
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,240
No, of course not.

131
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,500
Jeff doesn't have the right to impose conditions on Albin,

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,838
because it's not his hut.

133
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:25,949
If Jeff physically removes Albin,

134
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,959
does he then become the rightful owner of the hut?

135
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,668
No. Jeff would be in the wrong.

136
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:33,918
The hut still belongs to Albin. He built it!

137
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,789
What if Jeff announced one day

138
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,939
that he owned the uninhabited northern hills, even though he'd never visited them

139
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:44,040
himself. And then attacked anyone who tried to use that land without his

140
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,400
permission.

141
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,968
Would that mean that the northern hills were his property?

142
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,569
No. That would just make him

143
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,569
a bully. He wouldn't really own the hills.

144
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,009
That's what I think too.

145
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,028
It sounds like you agree with me about the two ways a person can acquire

146
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,408
property.

147
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:02,139
first of all you can homestead a thing.

148
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:06,038
that means creating or improving something that wasn't previously owned.

149
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,959
Building a shelter using unowned materials on unowned land is an example

150
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,740
of homesteading.

151
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,650
The second way you can become an owner is if a thing's previous owner voluntarily

152
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:16,968
gives it to you.

153
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,348
This happens in trade with a giving happens in both directions.

154
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:25,098
There may be disagreements about exactly how you have to homestead something to

155
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,279
become its owner,

156
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,279
or how long you're allowed to leave a thing unused before someone else can

157
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,029
claim it,

158
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,100
but I think most people agree about the basics:

159
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,740
Jeff doesn't own Albin's shelter or the hills.

160
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,169
if voluntary transfer and original homesteading are the two ways to

161
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,969
become an owner of a thing

162
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,310
then most of the state's claims to land ownership are suspect.

163
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:48,689
that's because most of the land was already owned when the state took it by

164
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,320
force. Or the land was unowned and instead of homesteading it the state

165
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,010
threatened to punish users who didn't seek its permission.

166
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,139
So the state behaves like Jeff stealing Albin's shelter or announcing that he

167
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,629
owns the hills.

168
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,929
But we don't believe ownership works that way. If we want to be consistent

169
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,599
I think we have to admit that the state doesn't own most of the land and that

170
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,570
there is no legitimate agreement

171
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,220
between the state and most of the people it taxes.

172
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,370
There is no real social contract, just threats of violence

173
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,360
But if we go back far enough

174
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,180
there are many pieces of land that were taken by force from someone.

175
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,709
I live on land that was stolen less than two hundred years ago

176
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,720
does that mean I don't have a right to live there?

177
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,250
It's a good question.

178
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,429
A descendant of the person the land  was stolen from could show up and

179
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,679
demonstrate that they have a better claim on the land than you do.

180
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,000
But if no surviving descendants are interested, then it might qualify as abandoned

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,110
land.

182
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,620
Abandoned land is treated like a land that was never owned.

183
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,259
It can be homestead and passed on through voluntary exchange afterwards.

184
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,340
Okay.

185
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,389
That does sort of make sense.

186
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:01,449
But i'm not completely convinced yet. Let me think about it some more.

187
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,790
Whatever it's used for,

188
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,048
and however is justified, taxation depends on a chain of increasingly

189
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:12,480
unpleasant demands and punishments ultimately backed by deadly force.

190
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,570
Some people believe the state maintains mass threats of violence against

191
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,320
peaceful people, that it illegitimately claims ownership of the land we live on,

192
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,720
and that is an aggressive institution incompatible with a truly civil society.

193
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,610
