1
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:07,067
Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand's timeless classic,

2
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:10,646
tell us about how the world's best producers innovators and creative minds

3
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:15,855
disappear from a society crumbling under the weight of government intervention and collectivism.

4
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:20,544
But at its heart, it's a powerful philosophical declaration of individualism,

5
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:25,048
rational self-interest and the role of reason in human life.

6
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:29,055
In my life, Atlas Shrugged has inspired me to be great.

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,375
When I entered college I became frustrated by the irrationality around me.

8
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:37,611
I soon found philosophy appealing because of its respect for a reason and truth.

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,840
So I majored in it. 

10
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:43,756
But ironically, it was in this field that I encountered some of reason's harshest critics.

11
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:50,504
After discussing this with my older brother, he introduced me to Atlas Shrugged and the works of Ayn Rand.

12
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:53,768
I was completely blown away by the powerful ideas.

13
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:57,245
I decided to use reason as the foundation for my life.

14
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,813
And a rational self-regarding happiness as my moral purpose.

15
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:09,724
With this new found clarity of vision, I ignored the irrational negative forces around me, and freed my mind from illogical limitations. 

16
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:18,540
My life blossomed as I shifted my focus from parties and mindless activities to the pursuit of wisdom, art and filmmaking.

17
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:22,099
I graduated as a senior who showed the most academic improvement;

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
Found the courage to pursue the girl of my dreams; 

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,805
And have embarked on my goal to create a major production company.

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,786
Just as this book helped me at a critical time in my life,

21
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:36,503
our society needs this books principles now more than ever.

22
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,319
We've recently witnessed the crumbling of our economic system.

23
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:44,282
And just as in Atlas Shrugged, politicians have wrongly blamed free market capitalism.

24
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,188
And have demonised innovators and producers.

25
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:54,412
Instead of preserving the individual rights of our country's citizens, the government have trampled them.

26
00:01:54,882 --> 00:02:01,867
Hard working people are being looted through taxes, bailouts, stimulus bills and dollar devaluation policies.

27
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,672
instead of allowing free market system to work,

28
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:10,045
government leaders have rewarded irresponsible corporations who have the Washington connections.

29
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:16,163
While offering collective "solutions" that crushed the profit motive of producers, innovators and entrepreneurs,

30
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,891
by confiscating the fruits of their labor.

31
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:22,961
The Heroes of Atlas Shrugged simply wanted freedom.

32
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:26,563
Will we awake into the lessons of Atlas Shrugged?

33
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:33,120
Or will we find ourselves asking "who is John Galt?"
