1
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:26,919
Simon's new at the factory.

2
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,259
If you ask him

3
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:31,018
he'll tell you it's a lousy job.

4
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,619
He has to sweep up and carry things around.

5
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,519
He only earns three dollars an hour.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Even so

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
Simon prefers working here

8
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,229
to the alternatives he sees for himself right now.

9
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:46,959
Although his wage is low

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,509
Simon appreciates the independence it gives him.

11
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,929
Next week he'll learn how to use a forming machine.

12
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:01,259
That will makes things more interesting.

13
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,358
That's Edgar,

14
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,260
the owner of the factory.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,340
the only thing he really cares about is making profit.

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,560
Edgar would prefer to pay his workers a tiny fraction of their current wages

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,909
to keep more money for himself.

18
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,359
but he knows that wouldn't work.

19
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,900
Edgar is in competition with many other business owners.

20
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,700
They all need a steady supply of human labour.

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,689
When deciding whether or not to trade with an employer

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:36,549
workers consider wages but also working conditions and other benefits.

23
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:39,019
If Edgar's offers aren't attractive enough

24
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:42,879
workers won't sell him the labour he needs to run his factory.

25
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,469
So reluctantly Edgar ends up paying market prices for the labour

26
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,829
he buys.

27
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,789
In another part of town there's a celebration.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,618
This group of concerned citizens just got a minimum wage law passed.

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,700
They were appalled

30
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,769
that miserly employers like Edgar

31
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,629
could get away with paying so little to workers like Simon.

32
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,209
The new minimum wage

33
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,789
is nine dollars an hour.

34
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:11,949
Unfortunately

35
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:14,419
this doesn't mean that everyone in the town will now

36
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,649
earn nine dollars or more.

37
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:17,729
We already saw

38
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,608
how the existence of competing buyers of labour influences the lower limit

39
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,469
on what Edgar can get away with paying his workers.

40
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:29,370
The upper limit on what Edgar will pay any worker

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,269
is the amount of extra revenue

42
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,338
he expects that worker's labour

43
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,400
will create for him

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,528
in a given period.

45
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,659
In other words

46
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,579
employers won't knowingly pay workers more than the extra income they generate.

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,239
They'd be losing money if they did that.

48
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,378
So what does the introduction of the minimum wage law mean for the

49
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,870
workers at Edgar's factory?

50
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,878
Vicky's work

51
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,038
generates twenty three dollars an hour for Edgar. And her wage is fifteen

52
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:00,458
dollars an hour.

53
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,938
For every hour that Vicky works for Edgar

54
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:05,259
he's left with an extra eight dollars

55
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,638
after he's paid her wage.

56
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,349
Because Vicky's wage is higher than nine dollars an hour

57
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:16,628
the new law doesn't affect her directly.

58
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:21,408
Bob's labor at the factory generates ten dollars an hour for Edgar,

59
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:24,649
and his wage is eight dollars an hour.

60
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:29,248
After paying Bob's wage Edgar is left with an extra two dollars

61
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:32,098
for every hour that Bob has worked.

62
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,608
But because Bob's wage

63
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,580
is less than the legal minimum,

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,499
if Edgar wants to keep him on

65
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,680
he'll have to pay him more.

66
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,919
Edgar calculates

67
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,800
that if he raises Bob's wage

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,469
to the new minimum of nine dollars he'll still be gaining one extra dollar for

69
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:51,868
every hour of Bob's labor, after his wages have been paid.

70
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:56,949
Although Edgar will profit less from employing Bob at nine dollars instead of eight,

71
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:59,348
a little profit is better than none.

72
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:04,218
So Bob gets a raise.

73
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:05,388
But the new law

74
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,419
is bad news for Simon.

75
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,899
Simon's labour generates only four dollars an hour for Edgar.

76
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,968
The nine dollar minimum wage

77
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,858
is five dollars more than that.

78
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,038
Edgar would be losing five dollars an hour

79
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:20,468
by keeping Simon on

80
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,810
at the new legal minimum.

81
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,069
So Simon doesn't get a raise.

82
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:25,848
Instead

83
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:31,319
he loses his job.

84
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,699
Edgar is irritated.

85
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,588
The minimum wage means

86
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:37,990
that if he wants to stay in business

87
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,120
he has to either invest in machines

88
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,069
to do the work that unskilled labourers like Simon were doing.

89
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:46,718
Or he has to move production to another country

90
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:50,209
where minimum wage laws aren't a problem.

91
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,209
Edgar believes

92
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:54,350
both of these options are less profitable for him

93
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,040
than employing local workers,

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,819
otherwise he wouldn't have hired Simon.

95
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,860
For Simon

96
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,660
the outlook is bleak.

97
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,620
Losing his job would have been bad enough,

98
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,639
but the minimum wage continues to disadvantage him even while he's

99
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,590
unemployed.

100
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,698
Because he's young

101
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,069
and doesn't have much experience, it's likely that the extra revenue Simon's

102
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,189
labour would create for any employer would be low.

103
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,530
Potential employers expect to lose money

104
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,668
hiring Simon

105
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,990
at the minimum wage

106
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,660
so they turn down his applications.

107
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,949
Simon was glad of his factory job, even with its low wage.

108
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,038
He hoped to build up experience

109
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,000
which would raise his productivity

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,819
and give him a chance to move to better paid and more satisfying work.

111
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,910
But the new law prevents him from doing so.

112
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,449
This is why the minimum wage has been described as removing the bottom rungs

113
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,468
from the economic ladder.

114
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:58,889
When we see social interactions that seem unfair

115
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,759
one response is to demand that the behaviour we disapprove of

116
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,189
be outlawed.

117
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,569
But we should keep in mind that this kind of intervention

118
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,319
has unintended consequences.

119
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,049
Some people suspect that prohibiting voluntary exchange often does more harm

120
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,628
than good.

121
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,580
They believe

122
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,288
the proper function of law

123
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:24,098
is to discourage the initiation of force,

124
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,139
and that we shouldn't create barriers that

125
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:33,028
prevent people from doing their best to peacefully improve their lives.
